# This is the simple Travis configuration, which is intended for use

# EAC: By default, TravisCI has gcc/g++-4.6.3, which is too old for lol-cpp.
# I tried explicitly using gcc-4.9, but couldn't install unix-2.7.0 with that
# (linking errors). Instead, I'm using "dist:trusty", which has a newer version
# of gcc (4.8.4) by default.

# Ensure necessary system libraries are present

# Build the package, its tests, benchmarks, executables, and its docs and run the tests
# --fast is about 33% faster (compile time + test time) than without --fast
