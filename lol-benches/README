This library contains modules which benchmark different layers of Lol.
Choose which layers you want to benchmark,
and call the appropriate funtion with a proxy for the relevant parameters.

Primarily, this can be used to benchmark third-party 'Tensor' instances,
but it also includes some useful tools for writing crypto application benchmarks.

Unless you are writing your own benchmarks, you shouldn't explicitly need this
package.
