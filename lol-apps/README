Overview of applications:

* SymmSHE.hs gives an implementation of a symmetric-key,
  somewhat-homomorphic encryption scheme that is essentially
  equivalent to the one from the toolkit paper [LPR'13].

* KeyHomomorphicPRF.hs gives an implementation of the
  key-homomorphic pseudo-random function from Banerjee
  and Peikert in Crypto 2014 ([BP14]).

* HomomPRF provides an interface for the homomorphic evaluation of the [BP14]
  PRF.

Note that an example using each application can be found in the 'examples'
directory. Tests and benchmarks for SHE and KeyHomomorphicPRF are provided in
the 'tests' and 'benchmarks' directories. Tests and benchmarks for HomomPRF are
included in the example for HomomPRF.
