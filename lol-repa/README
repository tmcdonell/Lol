This package contains a pure Haskell implementation of the 'Tensor' interface for
Lol, using the highly optimized and parallelizable array library Repa.

You can test this package by running `stack test lol-repa`, and benchmark by
running `stack bench lol-repa`.

The benchmarks for this package take ~6-7GB to compile with GHC-8.0.2.
